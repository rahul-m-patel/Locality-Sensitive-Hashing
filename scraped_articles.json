This is also where the typical rent per month is the most expensive.\n\nThe Zoopla report suggests that the typical tenant in the UK spends nearly a third of their earnings on rent (31.8%), slightly less than the peak in 2016.\n\nOutside of London, tenants spent the highest proportion of earnings in Oxford, Brighton and Cambridge, with the lowest in Hull, Bradford and Stoke.\n\nUK-wide rental prices are up by an average of 2% in the last year, which is about half the typical level of wage rises.\n\n\"Renting is more affordable today than the 10-year average. [An increase in] first-time buyers, 80% of whom exit the private renting sector to buy, has also moderated rental demand,\" said Richard Donnell, of Zoopla, which has based the figures on its listings and other data.\n\n\"Rental affordability varies widely across the country, reflecting the relative strength of local economies.\"\n\nAcross the UK, homes take an average of 17 days to rent, based on the time between a listing being posted and removed. This is down from one year ago, when homes took 19 days to rent, and much shorter than the time it takes to sell a property.\n\nThe typical tenant spent nearly four years in the same property, Mr Donnell said."}, {"DocID": 4, "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50064215", "published": "2019-10-15T20:58:45", "title": "Harry's emotional moment during speech over Meghan's pregnancy", "text": "Video\n\nThe Duke of Sussex shared an intimate moment with attendees at the WellChild Awards.\n\nHe recalled how he knew at last year's event that his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, was pregnant and they were both thinking about what it would be like to be parents one day.\n\nThe charity, of which Prince Harry is patron, helps seriously ill children spend time out of hospital and return home to be with their families.\n\nHe welled up as he spoke at the ceremony, which celebrates the children, their families and the people who support them."}, {"DocID": 5, "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-50064546", "published": "2019-10-16T06:30:51", "title": "Turkey-Syria offensive: Erdogan rejects US ceasefire call", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch as Syrian government forces enter town of Ain Issa\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected a US call for an immediate ceasefire in northern Syria.\n\nMr Erdogan's comments come ahead of a visit to Turkey by the US vice-president and US secretary of state.\n\nTurkey launched an offensive designed to drive away Kurdish troops after their main ally, the US, pulled out.\n\nRussia, which backs Syria, has said it prevent clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces which have now moved into the area after a deal with the Kurds.\n\nTurkey considers elements of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a terrorist organisation and want to push them away from the border area.\n\nAnkara also says it wants to create a \"safe zone\" reaching about 30km (20 miles) into Syria to resettle up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.\n\nHowever, Syrian forces - which are backed by Russia - advanced north at the weekend following a deal with the Kurds to try to hold back the Turkish operation.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration say the withdrawal of US troops from the region gave Turkey a \"green light\" for the offensive.\n\nThe US has repeatedly denied this, and on Monday Washington announced sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials.\n\nDozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far and at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN.\n\nOn Tuesday, the medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it had \"taken the difficult decision to suspend the majority of its activities and evacuate all its international staff from north-east Syria\".\n\nWhat did President Erdogan say?\n\n\"They say 'declare a ceasefire'.

She could have been two miles away; it\u2019s just she was in the room next door. Our grief\u2019s been locked in for several weeks. It\u2019s not appropriate to meet her without therapists and mediators for us as a family but also for her.

Dunn\u2019s parents also praised his warm and compassionate manner, noting that he held Charles\u2019s hand.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House, Charles recalled: \u201cWhen we first got there, he extended his condolences to us, which did feel sincere.

We didn\u2019t get the answers that we wanted. They couldn\u2019t tell us who made the decision to let her come back to the US. We asked how long she was there for; they still state it was three weeks; we\u2019re not totally sure about that. And I think paperwork needs to be shown to prove that somehow.\u201d\n\nBut she said her son would have been \u201cproud\u201d of his parents taking his case all the way to the White House and meeting the US president. \u201cHe was always one to stand up for his rights when he knew he was in the right,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe would do everything that he could possibly do to make sure that he had that heard, anyone that he felt was being served any injustice ... he would have their back.

Its owners, the Green family, are prominent Christian evangelicals and, under the guidance of the Hobby Lobby president, Steve Green, were behind the founding of Washington\u2019s $400m Museum of the Bible in 2017.\n\nA statement published by the Egypt Exploration Society, which manages the Papyri project, claimed it was told by the Museum of the Bible that 11 fragments were sold to it by Obbink in two batches in 2010.\n\nThe society and the university confirmed Obbink was under investigation. He continues to be employed at Oxford. The Guardian has contacted him for comment.\n\nThe lecturer in papyrology and Greek literature has previously denied some of the allegations, telling the Daily Beast in 2018 that the claim he sold a fragment of the first chapter of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby was not true.\n\nIn its statement, the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the collection and conducted the investigation, said the issue had contributed to Obbink\u2019s removal as general editor of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project \u201cbecause of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn June 2019 the [society] banned him from any access to its collection pending his satisfactory clarification of the 2013 contract [for another fragment sale]. Oxford University is now investigating, with [the society\u2019s help], the removal from university premises and alleged sale of [society] texts.\u201d\n\nThe statement said file records relating to the missing fragments had also been removed. \u201cThese texts were taken without authorisation from the EES, and in most of the 13 cases the catalogue card and photograph are also missing.\u201d\n\nThe statement follows intensive investigations after reports in the Daily Beast this year speculated about the possibility that Obbink had sold a highly prized fragment \u2013 if it is real \u2013 of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby and the Green family.\n\nThe report quoted a blogpost by the New Testament scholar Brent Nongbri, who published an email sent by Michael Holmes of the Museum of the Bible appearing to confirm that \u201cObbink sold [the fragment of Mark] and three other allegedly early gospel fragments to the Green collection\u201d, adding a copy of the contract.\n\nCommenting after the statement on Monday, Nongbri said: \u201cThe sale of the manuscripts and the attempt to cover it up by removing records is almost unbelievable. But the first thing to note are the words \u2018so far\u2019. We don\u2019t yet know the full extent of this. More items may well have been sold to Hobby Lobby.\u201d\n\nThe Green family and Steve Green have been embroiled in multiple scandals over the long-running programme of purchasing biblical fragments for the Museum of the Bible. According to the Egypt Exploration Society, its investigations have revealed that 13 pieces in the museum\u2019s collection are in fact the rightful property of the nonprofit society.\n\nIn a statement, the Museum of the Bible said the antiquities were \u201csold illegally\u201d by a \u201cknown expert\u201d, adding that of the 13 items identified, only four were the property of the museum, with the remainder belonging to Hobby Lobby as part of the Green collection.\n\nThe Green family has assembled what it describes as one of the largest collections of biblical antiquities in the world, many of which are on display in the Museum of the Bible.\n\nHowever, the Greens and the museum have been dogged by controversy over the provenance of some of its acquisitions. In June 2017, Hobby Lobby Stores was ordered to pay a $3m fine for illegally importing thousands of ancient Iraqi artefacts that were falsely labelled and shipped to the company through the United Arab Emirates and Israel.\n\nCommenting after that case Hobby Lobby said it \u201cdid not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process\u201d and relied on dealers who did not understand how to properly ship the items.\n\nIn a second high-profile controversy, the Green family and the Museum of the Bible were forced to remove five document fragments \u2013 described as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 when they were identified as modern forgeries after reporting by the Guardian and other media organisations."}, {"DocID": 16, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/twitter-explains-how-it-handles-world-leaders-amid-pressure-to-rein-in-trump", "published": "2019-10-16T03:03:09", "title": "Twitter lays out rules for world leaders amid pressure to rein in Trump", "text": "Blogpost sheds new light on how tweets will be treated but is unlikely to satisfy those calling for Trump\u2019s censorship\n\nTwitter on Tuesday published additional information about how it plans to act if a world leader tweets something that violates its rules.

Meanwhile, in September, the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris wrote to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, calling on him to suspend Trump\u2019s account over six tweets containing \u201cblatant threats\u201d against the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower and an invocation of the threat of \u201ccivil war\u201d.

MoMA goes global with an explosive $450m rehang", "text": "In his Poetics, Aristotle argued that poetry was a more scientific and serious genre than history. This was because, he said, history is concerned only with individual and particular events. Poetry, on the other hand, is concerned with what might happen: that is, deep and general truths. In the newly revamped Museum of Modern Art in New York, which reopens on 21 October, the march of history, at least as it has been understood by MoMA in recent decades, is out and poetry is in.\n\nInside the refreshed museum \u2013 its gallery space enlarged by 30% thanks to architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro \u2013 a radical rehang reverses the museum\u2019s old \u201cBook of Genesis\u201d approach, as MoMA director Glenn D Lowry characterised it. Recent decades have seen the museum organised by way of a stately procession, in which art movements and -isms were shown to have begotten other movements and -isms.\n\nThis lucid, but necessarily sealed-off, worldview has now been replaced with the kind of thematic approach familiar to British audiences from two decades of Tate Modern hangs. While still arranged according to a broad chronology, beginning with the 1880s on the fifth floor and descending to the present on the second, MoMA\u2019s individual rooms are organised around ideas, with titles such as War Within, War Without, Inner and Outer Space, and True Stories.\n\nThe view of art history on show here is no longer one of straight lines and linear progressions, but one much more like the complex ripples set in motion by pebbles thrown into a pond. No longer will MoMA claim to tell a single story of modern and contemporary art. Every six months, the hang will substantially change.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Into orbit \u2026 The Moon, 1928, by pioneering female modernist Tarsila do Amaral. Photograph: Robert Gerhardt/MoMA\n\nSome might say MoMA is letting itself off the hook: no definitive statements are made and everything is allowed to hover provisionally until the next remix. Lowry argues it is returning to the museum\u2019s founding principles. The great first director, Alfred H Barr Jr, wrote: \u201cNothing that the visitors will see in the exhibition galleries, neither the works of art, nor the lighting fixtures, nor even the partitions, is at present permanent.\u201d\n\nBarr understood, said Lowry, \u201cthat the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as the world of contemporary art changed and evolved\u201d. The museum\u2019s glaciation of its displays came later, in the 1960s and 70s, he said. Nevertheless, even in the brave indeterminate future, there will remain a few constants. Some works \u2013 Monet\u2019s Water Lilies, Picasso\u2019s Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon \u2013 will always be there. \u201cWe\u2019d have a revolution if we took down the Water Lilies,\u201d said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture, at a museum preview.\n\nUnderlying the new mix-it-up approach is the argument that teleological art history \u2013 seeing the present as the logical culmination of the past \u2013 lacks contingency, fails to take into account the idea that once upon a time C\u00e9zanne, say, was just a bloke making strange paintings in the south of France, not an art history colossus whose work had a mind-blowing market value. So the new hang is not a \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d of famous masterpiece after famous masterpiece, as Temkin phrased it. While we spoke, we were sitting with our backs to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Bather, newly cleaned, with zingy blue details revealed of its background of rocks and water. To our right were Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night and Henri Rousseau\u2019s The Dream. So far, so \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne and Rousseau now hang near ceramics by the \u2018mad potter of Biloxi\u2019 George Ohr. Photograph: Jonathan Muzikar\n\nBut in a case in front of us was a selection of exquisite, earth-toned ceramics by American George Ohr, the self-styled \u201cmad potter of Biloxi\u201d. You could argue that these modest pots made in obscurity in Mississippi are irrelevant to the masterpieces of French post-impressionism. The point, according to Temkin, is to try to bring us back to around 1890 \u2013 when Van Gogh was painting in an asylum, Rousseau was collecting taxes, and no one knew what would be inscribed into the canon and what wouldn\u2019t. Above all, she explained, the connections are visual. Gesturing at the warm-brown ceramics, she said: \u201cYou could almost make a C\u00e9zanne out of those colours.\u201d\n\nRepudiating the Book of Genesis approach involves breaking up the patriarchal parade of white, male artists. So in a room titled Stamp, Scavenge, Crush \u2013 which centres on art using discarded or reused materials from the late 1940s to the early 60s, and features Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly \u2013 are also a photographic work by the African American Romare Bearden and a bedsheet printed by Ruth Asawa in 1948 with a stamp to create a dense, graphic pattern. (\n\nShe was using the Black Mountain College laundry stamp \u2013 she was running the art school\u2019s laundry at the time, while learning about design and pattern from ex-Bauhaus masters such as Anni Albers.) Twenty-eight per cent of works now on view at MoMA are by women, a crushingly small proportion even taking into account the fact that 13% can\u2019t neatly be assigned to a gender (because they are by collectives, for example). But 28% is still five times as high as the proportion in the galleries at the beginning of the century.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fragile strength \u2026 Prison Notebook, 1976, by Ibrahim el-Salahi. Photograph: Robert Gerhardt/MoMA\n\nThis rebalancing has meant enlarging the collection \u2013 a process enabled by MoMA\u2019s considerable resources and the tradition of American philanthropy along with its ability to sell off works in order to buy new ones. (British national museums\u2019 constitutions prevent them from doing this.) Selling a L\u00e9ger meant, Temkin explained, that the museum could purchase several works by \u201cpioneering female modernists\u201d. One, The Moon (1928), by Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral, acquired earlier this year, now holds court alongside Picasso, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and Eileen Gray. Donations include the extraordinarily extensive and coherent Cisneros collection of Latin American art, which for the time being will be shown as a kind of museum-within-a-museum. A wall of shimmeringly delicate wire sculptures by the Venezuelan Gego are a particular joy.\n\nThe labels beside works, specifically their date of acquisition, tell a story in themselves about recent innovations at MoMA. A wooden sculpture by Lebanon\u2019s Saloua Raouda Choucair entered the collection last year. A set of works by Polish artist Edward Krasi\u0144ski came in 2015. Ibrahim el-Salahi\u2019s Prison Notebook, illustrated with ink drawings, made after he was wrongfully imprisoned in Sudan in 1975, was acquired in 2017. Despite its fragility and scale, it holds its own in a room themed around the conflicts of the 1970s opposite Philip Guston\u2019s magisterial painting Deluge II, made at the same time. A dangling, curvaceous hemp sculpture by Indian artist Mrinalini Mukherjee was also acquired in 2017. Perhaps my eyes are drawn to familiar things, or perhaps it is just that curators in London and New York breathe the same air, but it strikes me that these last are all artists foregrounded by Tate Modern in current displays or recent exhibitions. At any rate, the message is loud and clear: the world is a big place, bigger than Manhattan and Paris \u2013 and great art is being made all around it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We\u2019d have a revolution if we took down Water Lilies\u2019 \u2026 Monet at MoMA. Photograph: Kurt Heumiller/Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\nThese themed rooms frequently draw on items from several of the institution\u2019s mighty departments, creating a mix of, for example, photography, film, publications and painting. So for example, in the room with Asawa\u2019s bedsheet there is a film of Merce Cunningham\u2019s dance work Antic Meet \u2013 like a lot of film in the galleries, simply projected on to a wall, offered as part of the mix. One of the most rewarding moments in the current hang is a modest, unobtrusive room devoted to Frank O\u2019Hara \u2013 from his manuscripts and early editions of books to artworks made by a host of greats to illustrate his work, and Larry Rivers\u2019s portrait of the poet.\n\nAll this has meant delving deep into the collection. Lowry said the museum had, to his eyes, become almost like two institutions in recent years \u2013 one that visitors had access to, and the other in store, where there was a much more varied and diverse set of art. A work by the Indian painter VS Gaitonde, for example, was purchased in 1963, and languished unseen for years \u2013 now, though, it\u2019s sharing wall space with Rothko. There is an entire case of radical zines and leaflets mailed to the museum in the early 1980s from Brazil \u2013 these items, from the Movimento de Arte Porn\u00f2, were unsought by the institution but dutifully catalogued and preserved.\n\nSome things, on the other hand, have been permanently banished from the galleries. Like Tate before it, MoMA will no longer bandy around terms such as cubism, post-impressionism, abstract expressionism, or conceptualism in its labels. \u201cWe were trying to imagine what we would say if we had a group of friends over to dinner who aren\u2019t in the art world,\u201d Lowry told me. \u201cWhat would we want them to know? What would they need to know in order to have an interesting conversation?\u201d It is certainly not, he argued, a \u201cdumbing down\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest American People Series #20: Die, 1967, by Faith Ringgold. Photograph: Jonathan Muzikar/MoMA\n\nThe results of this particular innovation are, at this point, mixed \u2013 after all, you can eradicate art-world lingo and still bypass lucidity. Sometimes, refusing the actual word seems like a round-in-the-hat game \u2013 in which participants pull a name out of a hat and describe it, without using the name itself. The introductory text of one room, titled Readymade in Paris and New York, seems, for example, to be a more or less a hat-game description of the word dada. Indeed, hanging beside it is Richard Boix\u2019s drawing of members of the New York dada group (Man Ray, Duchamp, Katherine Dreier and others), with the word DADA writ large on it. But since the room introduction doesn\u2019t tell you what dada is, you\u2019d be none the wiser if you didn\u2019t already know.\n\nAll of these changes have been a long time coming. Back at the turn of the millennium, soon after Lowry was appointed, the museum experimented with a series of thematic displays called MoMA 2000. Some critics loved them; some utterly rejected them. Lowry denies the museum rowed back after the mixed reception, but, rather, the displays marked the beginning of a process that has culminated in this month\u2019s reopening, one that involved great institutional change. \u201cIt required over time a new generation of curators who came with fresh and new ideas and for whom interdisciplinarity was something natural. And we had to expand on training our vision,\u201d he said. Over the last decade, research groups on Asian, Latin American and African art have been formed at the museum. Curators have travelled more. The great MoMA tanker has gradually turned.\n\nUnsealing the edges of modern and contemporary art in this way has, said Temkin, been \u201cliberating, exhilarating. One thing I\u2019ve been insisting on is changing the way people speak about gaps in the collection. It feels so wrong because it assumes there is a complete puzzle, and if we just find every single puzzle piece, one day it will be solved and complete. Right now, we are saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t know \u2013 there is no way of knowing some complete art history.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Work by Duchamp, Man Ray, Richard Boix and others in the Readymade in Paris and New York room. Photograph: Denis Doorly/MoMA\n\nThe museum, once a place of such authority, is now letting that authority go, admitting the impossibility of a fully coherent narrative, embracing the fact that it cannot tell the viewer everything. Strangely, its sleek and efficient spaces, so four-square, pale and elegant, renewed and enlarged at a cost of $450m (\u00a3356m), seem slightly at odds with this new intellectual porousness, despite architect Elizabeth Diller\u2019s efforts to make it more friendly and open. It remains an intensely decorous, formal, demure museum (and it is $25 for a ticket, though the ground-floor displays, which currently include a room of paintings by Kenya-born Michael Armitage, can be visited for free). Perhaps a longing for unruliness was why I was so happy to see the holes punched out of the walls, revealing the grubby plywood sheets and dust balls lurking behind them, in a display devoted to the multidisciplinary performance artist Pope.L.\n\nThe most striking example of MoMA\u2019s new approach \u2013 as well as a relatively rare abjuration of broad chronology \u2013 is placing Picasso\u2019s Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon beside a visceral painting, by African American artist Faith Ringgold, documenting the 1965 Los Angeles race riots. (The 1967 work, American People Series #20: Die, was seen at Tate Modern in the 2017 exhibition Soul of a Nation.) The formal consonances between the works, made 60 years apart, are clear. MoMA\u2019s contention is that the Picasso might illuminate the Ringgold \u2013 but also that the Ringgold might illuminate the Picasso. History, in other words, might not be working in only one direction. Which is where poetry comes in.

Spiked bleached blonde hair, sculpted biceps, low-slung cargo pants with Doc Martens, veins bursting from her neck, eyes bugging from her drawn face.\n\nShe stood on the sidewalks of New York City with a folding table covered with poster-size images from hardcore pornography: women wearing dog collars, women on leashes, women leaned over and viewed from behind, their backs crosshatched with scars. Much of the time she displayed a blowup of the famous Hustler magazine cover showing a naked woman being fed upside down into a meat grinder.\n\n\u201cThis is what your husbands are masturbating to,\u201d she shouted in a barking monotone. \u201cWake up, women! Don\u2019t be passive! Sign the petition!\u201d\n\nMost everyone turned away or just kept walking. This was back in 1990. I was 20.\n\nTo be 20 years old in 1990 in New York City was, as far as I was concerned, to own the world. I owned practically nothing of material value back then, but somehow this was all part of a magical transaction in which I knew I\u2019d eventually get ahead even if it seemed, for the moment, like I could barely keep up. The city was still a wild kingdom, a stone-and-steel fortress with rage burning inside. The crack epidemic was long under way and also a long way from ending. Aids was everywhere \u2013 ravaging the bodies of the visibly ill and beckoning from public service announcements that preached condoms or death. The graffiti was only beginning to come off the subway cars.\n\nEvery man, woman and, yes, many children (including those commuting to fancy prep schools) had been mugged or knew someone who had. Every woman knew what it was like to be creepily rubbed against by some dude in a crowded space, and when this happened many of us either jammed our elbows into his abdomen or rolled our eyes and moved away.\n\nOne time, as I walked down a mostly empty Columbus Avenue around midnight, a man walked up to me \u2013 a redheaded, bearded man perhaps 10 years my senior \u2013 reached his hand out, and shoved me just below my left collarbone. It was a fairly hard shove, and I almost lifted my arm to shove him back. Instead, the moment passed and I just looked at him in disgust and confusion as we both continued along our way. I remember feeling grateful that the situation hadn\u2019t escalated into anything worse.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t remember is connecting the incident to anything like what would now be called institutionalized misogyny. This was not systemic oppression of women. This was simply life in the big city.\n\nToday, the angry, ranting woman with the folding table is gone from the sidewalk. In her place are millions of angry women marching in the streets and, even more so, ranting online. We are tiny pixels coalescing into a giant portrait of rage in all its definitions.\n\nTwenty years after the redheaded man shoved me on Columbus Avenue, men were going down like bowling pins against the unstoppable forces of #MeToo. What could you call the fall of 2017 other than the Fall of the Fall of Man. It was a season of hurricanes and rapid soil erosion, namely the mudslide that began with Harvey Weinstein and quickly pulled more men down with it than anyone could reasonably keep up with.\n\nOr maybe that\u2019s the wrong metaphor. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a mudslide as much as a giant oil spill from the tanker on which contemporary western society had been carrying its assumptions about male behavior. Like fossil fuels themselves, this behavior had long been construed as a necessary evil, one for which any purported cure seemed as futile and flimsy as a reusable shopping bag. (Hit him with your stiletto if he gets handsy! Make him get in touch with his feelings! Pry his eyes open and force him to read the Scum Manifesto!)\n\nI\u2019m not going to even try to summarize the events of that fall or list the men who went down in the spill of #MeToo. Entire books will be written about that movement, the best of which probably can\u2019t be embarked upon until enough years have passed to allow authors even a modicum of perspective. What I can tell you about the fall of 2017 is that it coincided with a downward slope of my youth that was far steeper than I had any grasp of at the time.\n\nThe autumn of 2017 marked my second year back in New York City after being away for the better part of two decades, most of it in California. Though I\u2019d left California in 2015 in the wake of irremediable, if mercifully amicable, marital separation, it had taken nearly two years to officially get divorced, and this new status carried a sting whose effects sometimes proved paralytic. How could I have imagined that replacing the license plates on your car could feel like a death? (Somehow I\u2019d managed to keep my car registered in California until the last possible minute.) Who knew that shopping for a new health insurance policy could make you feel like you\u2019re on a plastic pool raft floating aimlessly in the Dead Sea? (OK, I guess everyone knows that.)\n\nI\u2019d left New York when I was nearly 30. I was now 47. Whereas my chief experience of the city was that of a young woman, I was now faced with re-entering it as a middle-aged one.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that I had been young in New York; New York was my youth. It was the place where I\u2019d spent my entire 20s. It was the place where I figured out what kind of person I wanted to be. That\u2019s a different thing from actually figuring out how to be that person, and it took leaving New York to accomplish that task, but as they like to say in California, setting your intention is the most important phase of the journey.\n\nNew York was the backdrop for my earliest triumphs and stupidities. It was the first and last place I ever lived where on any given night you could step outside and feel like absolutely anything could happen, that the course of your life could shift like a subway train switching from the local track to the express.\n\nIt was the place where I had my first real job, my first grown-up boyfriend, my first martini, my first call from a debt collector, my first call from a hospital pay phone telling me someone was in serious trouble. It was the site of my earliest rough drafts and rough treatments, the ones visited upon me as well as the ones I inflicted on others. Now that I had returned, it was as if my 20s were being handed back to me in used condition. What a strange remnant to hold in your hand; what a bittersweet walk down memory\u2019s plank.\n\nHere I was again, a girl alone and on the town. I was my most primordial self, a girl who was rabidly ambitious in some ways but inexplicably lazy in others. I was a girl who technically hadn\u2019t been a girl for the better part of 30 years but who nonetheless felt a strange remove from the word \u201cwoman\u201d, which seemed to convey a poise and seriousness I hadn\u2019t yet attained.\n\nI may have been in my mid-40s, but I was still all jokes and hammy self-deprecation, still unable to accept compliments, still flirting with men by defaulting to my best Diane Keaton in Manhattan impression, even though it had been decades since I was attracted to the kind of men who were attracted to that.\n\nI was all the things I\u2019d been when I was young except for the young part. I had a nicer apartment, a little more money, and a little more professional recognition. I had a dog (this I\u2019d longed for in my 20s the way some women long for babies) and a car that I had to move for alternate-side street cleaning. But my days were more or less the same. I sat at my desk and drank coffee. I did my work when I could, but more often I stared into space and wondered what would become of my life. I surfed the internet at a connection speed that would have been unimaginable in 1995.\n\nIn part because of that connection speed, the space I stared into most of the time wasn\u2019t my own physical space but some unholy rotation of social media, news media and floating junk courtesy of cyberspace. By the time Donald Trump entered office, I probably spent at least three-quarters of my waking hours with my head in this space. By the time #MeToo reached full force, my brain no longer felt connected to my body. At times, my brain no longer felt associated with my brain as I\u2019d once known it. There were moments in which I couldn\u2019t remember the names of people I\u2019d been acquainted with for years.\n\nIn intense, animated conversations with friends and colleagues, I\u2019d find myself revving up to some sort of grand insight and then suddenly sputtering out mid-sentence, like a rollercoaster propelled halfway up a loop but unable to make it all the way around. Bunched up in my desk chair, I would stare at the computer screen for hours, hunting for words as though tracking lions on safari and practically sweating from the exertion. More than a few times I wondered if I was experiencing some form of dementia.\n\nI once read that there\u2019s scientific proof of a correlation between increased nostalgia and creeping senility. And since returning to New York, I\u2019d been soaking in nostalgia. Everywhere I went, my 20s played in my head like a song stuck there permanently. Every neighborhood, every subway station, in some areas every street corner, echoed with some memory from that time. There was John\u2019s pizzeria on Bleecker, where, at 21 and playing hooky from college upstate, I sat with a man \u2013 a boy, really \u2013 who both was and wasn\u2019t my boyfriend and listened to him reminisce about his old girlfriend, who, he said, was \u201csexy without being pretty, if that makes any sense\u201d.\n\nThere, among the slabs of buildings of Midtown Sixth Avenue, were the offices of more temp jobs than I could count: banks, law firms, insurance companies, each with its own mini kitchen and passcode-protected employee restrooms. There, at 57th and Broadway is a Duane Reade pharmacy that was once Coliseum Books, a place where the feral woman had often stood and yelled: \u201cSign the petition!\u201d\n\nI remember being dumped on Delancey Street, kissed on Charles Street, having a strange and short-lived personal assistant job in a musty apartment on Sutton Place.\n\nI remember standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 49th Street as hail rained down like shellfire one summer night following a long, somewhat drunken dinner with an older man in a powerful position whose meal invitations I dreaded but nonetheless felt obliged to accept.\n\nThose meals had started out as business lunches but then migrated into semi-business dinners. During these dinners, the man would tell me certain details about his personal life, which was in a state of acute crisis. I didn\u2019t particularly want to be there but I accepted the invitations because there was in this transaction the implicit notion that he could help my career, albeit in a rather vague, abstract way. I accepted them so because not doing so felt like a kind of professional self-sabotage, as foolish and irresponsible as missing deadlines.\n\nAt no time did the man make an ultimatum or proposition me directly. I never felt like I was being sexually harassed and obviously no one was kidnapping me from my apartment and forcibly escorting me to the Oyster Bar, where the man would sit waiting for me, smoking probably the fourth of 15 cigarettes he\u2019d smoke that night. I\u2019ll cop to a certain psychological gamesmanship on my part as well. I\u2019d occasionally bum a cigarette from him, an act that gave me a sense of distance and control but that surely read to him as an intimate gesture.\n\nAt least a few times, after I probably had one too many glasses of wine, I became rather suggestive and flirtatious, inquiring into his personal life, seeing how much I could get him to disclose as he got drunker. I did this in part as a defense mechanism. The more we talked about him, the less we talked about me. But I also did it because I wanted to mess with his head, and I was young enough then to think that doing so would serve as some kind of tacit punishment for his behavior.\n\nThe truth, of course (which anyone but a young twerp would have the wisdom to realize), was that messing with his head was its own reward for him. I wasn\u2019t censuring his behavior as much as reinforcing it. As for my own, I\u2019ve been cringing about it ever since.\n\nLooking back, it would be easy to say I behaved like this out of some instinctive subordination to the man\u2019s power. There\u2019s an element of truth to that, but there\u2019s also an angle at which the situation could be viewed as quite the opposite. From this angle, I behaved the way I did because in some ways the power imbalance between the two of us was tipped in my favor.\n\nI was young and the man was twice my age. He may have had professional power over me, but it was limited and in no way unilateral. In fact, thanks to the personal details I\u2019d siphoned out of him, I probably could have placed one phone call and made his life very difficult. And so I carried on with my coquettishness until somehow the meals became fewer and farther between and then finally ended, probably because he took up with someone else. I carried on this way because my life was an open horizon and his was an overstuffed attic.\n\nI behaved this way because I must have known on some unconscious level that, at 25, I had more of a certain kind of power than I was ever going to have in my life and that I might as well use it, even if the accompanying rush was laced with shame.\n\nThis was the summer of 1995. Alanis Morissette\u2019s Jagged Little Pill had come out that June, and I listened to it pretty much on constant repeat through August. One night, after doing my silly routine with this man and riding the subway home in self-disgust, I sat in my room and played Jagged Little Pill and then wandered into the kitchen to talk to my roommate. I remember grumbling to her about my dinner companion, complaining about his lechery while conveniently omitting the parts when I\u2019d dramatically exhaled on my cigarette, looked him straight in the eye, and said something devastatingly witty and possibly a tiny bit dirty. (I\u2019d like to add that I winked, but that wouldn\u2019t past the truth test, since I\u2019m physically unable to wink.)\n\nInstead I said: \u201cGod, what a perv.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds annoying,\u201d my roommate said. \u201cBut hey, you keep showing up. You must be getting something out of it.\u201d\n\nI behaved this way because I must have known that, at 25, I had more power than I was ever going to have in my life\n\nDuring the Fall of the Fall of Man, I thought a lot about the showing up I\u2019d done over the years. Every woman seemed to be taking this kind of inventory. It was like a novel everyone was reading, one with a plot that seemed easy enough to follow but whose underlying themes and messages amount to an abstruse thicket of personal projection and postmodern obfuscation.\n\nLike any sentient being, I\u2019d been shocked and disgusted by the Weinstein revelations and saw no reason to equivocate about the reliability of his accusers or the severity of his punishment. But as the list of perpetrators piled up and the public censure piled on, the conversation around #MeToo (lacking a specific category, each new scandal was not a story or an issue but a \u201cconversation\u201d) began to split down generational lines.\n\nThe first incident to put this divide in notably sharp relief involved a secret Google spreadsheet called the Shitty Media Men list. This was an anonymously sourced, living document meant to warn women about certain men in the media business, mostly publishing, who were known for inappropriate sexual or sexually charged behavior.\n\nIt included all kinds of men, from powerful editors to freelance writers, and described alleged misdeeds that ranged from \u201cweird lunch dates\u201d to inappropriate flirting to stalking to physical violence and all-out rape. And though the list was never officially published and disappeared from Google Docs almost as quickly as it emerged, enough screenshots were taken that the perpetrators became common knowledge almost immediately.\n\nWithin hours of the list\u2019s discovery, the chief line of inquiry around it, even more so than \u201cWho started it?\u201d, was whether infractions like \u201cweird lunches\u201d should be lumped in with crimes like rape. Unsurprisingly, I found myself on the side of the oldsters who were deeply troubled not just by this \u201clumping\u201d (again, there seemed to be only one operative word, and in this case it was \u201clump\u201d) but by the idea that anonymously sourced accusations could be made against publicly named people without warning or any sort of due process.\n\n\u201cThis is so wrong!\u201d my same-age friends and I ranted. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do this! These millennials don\u2019t get it!\u201d We said this as we forwarded the screenshots among each other, gawking at the names we recognized.\n\n\u201cWeird lunch!\u201d I said to more than one person. \u201cWelcome to publishing! I\u2019m going to write a memoir about my early days in New York and call it Weird Lunch.\u201d\n\nAnd as the \u201cconversation\u201d lurched along and the narrative of the \u201cgenerational divide\u201d became the default narrative, I found myself reminded of this passage of time on a daily, even hourly, basis. When a scandal broke involving the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari, I felt that my membership on Team Older Feminist was so official that I might as well take out a charge card at Eileen Fisher and call it a day (though has anyone under 40 ever used a \u201ccharge card\u201d?)\n\nAnd so the ground began to shake around the fault line. The older feminists scolded the younger ones for not being tough enough to take care of themselves. If the construction worker whistles at you, give him the finger! If the drunk guy sitting next to you at the wedding reception gets fresh, kick him in the shins!\n\nIn turn, the youngsters chastised the oldsters for enabling the oppressive status quo with cool-girl posturing. We shouldn\u2019t have to suppress our humanity by letting insults roll off us! We shouldn\u2019t have to risk our safety with physical violence because patriarchal norms have taught the drunk wedding guest he can act like that!\n\nNeither side was entirely wrong, of course. But both sides were talking past each other in ways that suggested there was no meeting in the middle. In the New York Times, Daphne Merkin identified a gulf between what women said publicly about #MeToo and the eye-rolling that went on in private. \u201cPublicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn private it\u2019s a different story. \u2018Grow up, this is real life,\u2019 I hear these same feminist friends say.\u201d\n\nIn the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose tendency toward a certain impish prudery has never made her popular among young feminists, wrote that the Ansari fracas, at least the version of it chronicled on Babe.net, constituted \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d. She decried the helplessness of \u201ca whole country full of young women who don\u2019t know how to call a cab\u201d.\n\nOn cable news, the HLN anchor Ashleigh Banfield looked straight into the camera and addressed \u201cGrace\u201d directly.\n\n\u201cWhat you have done in my opinion is appalling,\u201d said Banfield, calling the allegations \u201creckless and hollow\u201d and charging Grace with having \u201cchiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades\u201d.\n\nThis being cable news, Banfield\u2019s producers invited Katie Way to appear on the show. And this being the digital era, Way declined the offer not with a \u201cno thanks\u201d but by popping off an email that called Banfield a \u201cburgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminist has-been\u201d and noted that \u201cno woman my age would ever watch your network\u201d.\n\nAs I watched all of this whiz past me on my computer screen, sharpened by the reading glasses I\u2019d lately been forced to wear, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn\u2019t even want to know us.\n\nAt 25, I not only wanted to know people like Daphne Merkin and Ashleigh Banfield, I wanted to be them. There were hundreds of women in my imaginative orbit \u2013 some of them over 50 or possibly even 60 \u2013 whom I felt this way about. I knew none of them, but I wanted to be all of them. Together, they formed a great phalanx of wise elders whose only duty to me was to be themselves. My duty, in turn, was to watch and learn. By which I mean that was my duty to myself.\n\nBut something was different back then. I shared a planet with those elders. We occupied the same universe. We breathed the same air. The same cannot be said for the relationship between my generation and those that are coming up behind us.\n\nThe world has changed so much between my time and theirs that someone just 10 years younger might as well belong to a different geological epoch. To a young person, someone like me is not so much an elder as an extinction. Is it any wonder, then, that older generations\u2019 contributions to the conversation are, at best, a kind of verbal meteor shower, the flickering, nattering remains of planets that haven\u2019t existed for eons?\n\nSo this is where I find myself. Amid my exasperation and confusion, I have wandered into a devastating but oddly beautiful revelation: my generation will be the last to have known the world in its analog form. As a result, we\u2019ve grown old before actually getting old. We\u2019ve become dinosaurs before we\u2019re even 50.\n\nAnd it\u2019s here, from this primitive-creature vantage point, that I find myself pressed up against yet another revelation: the questions we face now when it comes to men and women are questions that arose a split second ago. Modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years. Civilization as we know it has been churning away for perhaps 6,000 years. Until the birth control pill came along in 1960, we were all essentially prisoners of nature, with women\u2019s conditions being markedly worse, sometimes obscenely so.\n\nUntil 1960, the idea that women could compete with men in the job market, that men should do housework, that women had any purpose in life higher than having babies and men had any purpose higher than financially supporting those babies or going to war to protect them, was something close to unthinkable.\n\nThat we have come so far in so little time is a marvel. That we should expect all the kinks to have been worked out by now is insane.\n\nIn the scheme of things, the 59 years that have elapsed between 1960 and today is a nanosecond, a flash of time so imperceptible that it has passed in increments of billions by the time you have read this sentence. It was already nearly 30 years ago that the feral woman was out there with her folding table yelling: \u201cSign the petition.\u201d It was already nearly 30 years ago that, as far as I was concerned, I owned the world. It feels like yesterday. Then again, every day feels like yesterday. Every day becomes yesterday before you know it."}, {"DocID": 20, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/brexit-weekly-briefing-all-eyes-on-eu-summit-as-deadline-looms", "published": "2019-10-16T06:00:13", "title": "Brexit weekly briefing: all eyes on EU summit as deadline looms", "text": "New extension beyond 31 October seems inevitable, even as PM gains support for his Brexit deal\n\nWelcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing.

Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish border Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Design Pics RF\n\nA weekend of talks, however, ended with Barnier saying there had been no major breakthrough. A timely deal looked \u201cimpossible\u201d, he said, warning that negotiations may have to continue as UK\u2019s Irish border plans represented an \u201cuntested\u201d risk.\n\nThe British proposal takes Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union, with the UK agreeing to enforce the bloc\u2019s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland and a rebate system to compensate affected businesses.\n\nWith Johnson edging steadily towards the numbers needed to pass a deal in the Commons as more hardline Eurosceptics and pro-deal Labour MPs indicated they could back a new agreement, momentum began to grow.\n\nDampening expectations somewhat, Finland\u2019s prime minister, Antti Rinne, warned there was not enough time left for a formal agreement before the summit began on Thursday and Barnier said a deal this week remained \u201cdifficult, but possible\u201d.\n\nBut after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator set Johnson a deadline of midnight on Tuesday to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea if he wanted a deal by Saturday, EU and UK sources said the two sides were on the brink of success \u2013 despite misgivings in Paris and Berlin at the rush to a deal.\n\nWhat next\n\nIt depends what happens at the summit. The prime minister has made a series of major U-turns, giving EU officials hope he will table a legal text based on the February 2018 Northern Ireland-only backstop rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage.\n\nWill Boris Johnson have a deal to put to MPs on Saturday? Read more\n\nDe jure, Northern Ireland would be in the UK\u2019s customs territory, but de facto it will be in Britain\u2019s, is the idea. (A similar deal was blown up by the DUP and the hardline ERG group last year, but both seem to be giving Johnson more leeway.)\n\nBut Johnson could also walk out on the summit and attack Brussels for intransigence. Or the two sides could agree to further negotiations next week, opening up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, to sign off on a deal. Either way, a new extension beyond 31 October looks inevitable.\n\nIdeally, Johnson would probably like to put a deal to parliament on 19 October come what may. But France and Germany want more time, and fudge, delay and prevarication have been the watchwords throughout the Brexit process. There is no reason to doubt they will not be now.\n\nBest of the rest\n\nTop comment\n\nIn the Guardian, Rafael Behr argues that any Johnson-style deal will sow the seeds of future confrontation with the EU:\n\nJohnson envisages a future in which the UK does not shadow EU market rules. The greater the regulatory divergence on either side of a border, the harder that border has to be. Zoom out further and you see a statement of intent by the UK to gain a competitive edge by undercutting its former EU partners. The original economic conception of Brexit is to make Britain a low-cost lure for investment. Brussels doesn\u2019t like the sound of that. May was persuaded of the need for strategic proximity to the rest of Europe and saw economic alignment as a necessary condition to achieve that. Johnson\u2019s view is different. In his world, the UK can develop an economic model conceived by people who despise the EU, alongside a foreign policy in which UK-EU relations are unaffected.

In Greater Sao Paulo, 1.2 million families live as squatters in abandoned buildings or makeshift houses or are homeless, according to the municipal housing secretary. Housing rights activists often take over dilapidated buildings to pressure the government to provide affordable housing. More than 150 buildings in the city have been seized by squatters.\n\nAD\n\nWith few affordable options, many families are forced to live in makeshift homes in slums outside the city.

The Canadian Foreign Ministry announced that it was at least temporarily suspending new weapons sales to Turkey on Tuesday, warning in a statement that Ankara\u2019s \u201cunilateral action risks undermining the stability of an already fragile region, exacerbating the humanitarian situation and rolling back progress\u201d achieved by the anti-ISIS coalition.\n\nSome European powers have already done the same. On Monday, European Union member states collectively pledged to suspend arms exports to Turkey \u2014 though they stopped short of implementing a formal bloc-wide embargo. But various countries, including Germany, France, Finland and Sweden, had enacted embargoes of their own by the weekend. Britain followed suit on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is not the action we expected from an ally,\u201d said British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, referring to Turkey. \u201cIt is reckless. It is counterproductive and plays straight into the hands of Russia, and indeed the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUPDATED LIST OF ARMS EMBARGO TO TURKEY\n\n\n\n\u2014 NATO allies\n\n\u2022 Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n\n\u2022 France \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\u2022 The Netherlands\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n\n\u2022 Norway \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4\n\n\u2022 Germany \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\n\n\u2022 Britain\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\n\n\u2022 Czechia \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff\n\n\n\n\u2014Non-NATO\n\n\u2022 Finland \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee\n\n\n\n\u2014 ALSO\n\n\u2022 EU \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa made a call to all member states to suspend arms exports to Turkey \u2014 Rag\u0131p Soylu (@ragipsoylu) October 15, 2019\n\nErdogan is not a popular figure in the West, where many governments view his increasingly autocratic rule to be corroding Turkish democracy. But the speed with which other governments came crashing down on Ankara struck others as somewhat curious.\n\n\u201cWestern powers unleashed a wave of sanctions against Turkey over its Syria incursion,\u201d tweeted Ragip Soylu, Turkey correspondent for the Middle East Eye. \u201cNONE of them wanted to [do] the same when Saudi Arabia massacred thousands in Yemen, murdered [journalist Jamal] Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition is worth considering. For years, Saudi Arabia has led a ruinous campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Airstrikes on critical infrastructure and a maritime blockade contributed to the collapse of Yemen\u2019s already impoverished economy. The bleak conditions led to one of the world\u2019s worst cholera epidemics while possibly more than half of the country remains in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, U.N. investigators suggested in September that the Saudis \u2014 and perhaps the Americans, British and French allies who armed them \u2014 could be guilty of potential war crimes over the course of the conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet none of the mounting anger over the multiyear war in Yemen that has been voiced by Western civil society and various lawmakers has translated into the same sweeping political action that a few days of Turkish incursions provoked this week.\n\nThere may be understandable reasons for this double standard. Turkey is a NATO member and a nominally democratic nation that\u2019s still seen in a different light than an opaque gulf monarchy. The besieged Syrian Kurdish faction that Turkey views as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group played a vital role in securing Western strategic interests in Syria \u2014 unlike the Iran-linked Houthis. And the Saudis remain big customers: In 2017 alone, E.U. countries granted licenses to export arms to Saudi Arabia worth close to $19 billion.\n\nFor all the Western antipathy toward Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Turkish president still seems to loom as a larger boogeyman. In Europe, Erdogan is widely seen as the dangerous demagogue next door. In the United States, he has become an adversary in allied clothing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cObsession with Erdogan has always distorted Turkey policy in Washington,\u201d Soner Cagaptay, author of \u201cErdogan\u2019s Empire: Turkey and the Politics of the Middle East,\u201d told Today\u2019s WorldView.\n\nIn the early years of his reign, Erdogan was the toast of Western capitals, hailed as an epoch-redefining liberal who was shaking up the Turkish state still dominated by an overweening military and an asphyxiating civil bureaucracy. \u201cBecause people so firmly believed that he was going to make Turkey democratic, they overlooked his democratic transgressions,\u201d Cagaptay said, pointing to earlier purges Erdogan\u2019s government carried out against political opponents.\n\nNow, though, Erdogan is reviled, especially by the American foreign policy establishment. And so Washington \u201cdistorts Turkey\u2019s policy in the other direction,\u201d said Cagaptay, seeing only the mustachioed would-be autocrat in Ankara, while ignoring widespread concerns, shared by many of Erdogan\u2019s domestic opponents, over the dangers of a Syrian Kurdish statelet emerging on the Turkish border.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey\u2019s incursions have now made its fraught relationship with the United States the focus of conversation in Washington. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly headed to Ankara for crunch talks over a possible cease-fire and way forward.\n\nIn an op-ed published this week in the Wall Street Journal, Erdogan sniped at his critics both in the West and the Arab world, arguing that he was cleaning up a mess that others had a hand in making. \u201cThe international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d wrote Erdogan, insisting that his government\u2019s new campaign would \u201crestore peace and stability.\u201d\n\nA legion of critics would disagree, pointing to reports of new atrocities, the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians, and fears of the resurgence of the Islamic State. But in a part of the world where regional powers pay little price for causing such havoc, Erdogan\u2019s gambit may end up being once more par for the course.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?

Not only does Johnson first have to strike a bargain with the European Union \u2014 itself a difficult task \u2014 he then must sell it at home. British domestic politics can be unforgiving, as Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May learned after making a deal with Brussels only to have it defeated three times in Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe key sticking point in the closed-door talks in Brussels was the future of Northern Ireland, which will depart the E.U. along with the rest of the United Kingdom. Both the U.K. and the E.U. say they want to keep open the border with the Republic of Ireland, to preserve the hard-won peace there. They have disagreed about how to achieve that, with the E.U. saying Northern Ireland would have to remain tightly aligned with its own rules.\n\nMay had said \u201cno U.K. prime minister would ever agree to\u201d a proposal that would create a customs border in the Irish Sea. And Johnson had resisted the idea. But on Tuesday, he seemed to be moving far closer to European demands in a bid to push the talks to a conclusion.\n\nE.U. leaders will meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday, when they will either sign off on a deal, agree to delay the Brexit date beyond October or brace for a sudden and uncontrolled British departure from the bloc.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarnier told reporters ahead of the marathon negotiations: \u201cEven if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult, to be frank, it is still possible this week.\u201d\n\nOne European diplomat involved in the negotiations said late Tuesday that \u201cthere is light in the tunnel, but for the moment it comes from only neon tubes, not from the exit.\u201d The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.\n\nThe Irish border has proved to be one of the most vexing issues facing negotiators over the past three years. The promise of an open border is central to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles, as the 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland are known.\n\nAD\n\nToday the boundary is mostly invisible. A driver whizzing between Belfast and Dublin is not required to stop for any customs check or security control. There are no tollbooths, no cameras, not even a signpost. Brexit could change all that.

The very next day, they were right back at it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPalmer, 32, is among several thousand U.S. troops and veterans who served in northern Syria and are witnessing the messy end of a years-long alliance with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S.-backed militia has been one of America\u2019s closest partners in the war against the Islamic State since 2014, and some 11,000 Kurdish fighters have been killed in combat against the terrorist group. But with President Trump\u2019s order to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria in the face of a Turkish offensive, those who have served alongside Kurdish forces are left to consider America\u2019s new place in the world.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re abandoning our closest ally in the fight against ISIS, and we\u2019re abandoning them to a fate that is going to end very poorly for them,\u201d said Palmer, who left active duty last year.

But the calamity on the ground in Syria has wrought angry reactions from service members like few other recent foreign policy decisions.\n\nAD\n\nTroops have reacted viscerally in interviews and on social media despite Defense Department restrictions on them expressing political opinions. Some who served in northern Syria also have spoken out despite associations with secretive Special Operations units that rarely speak to the media and do not want their service members identified.\n\nThe sequence of events have played a significant role in that.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 6, the White House announced that the United States would not stand in the way of a Turkish military offensive to remove the SDF near Turkey\u2019s border, despite two years of U.S. troops effectively serving in the area as a guard against just that.\n\nThe Pentagon pulled about 50 service members away from two Syrian border towns before the offensive began, and Trump ordered a quick withdrawal of the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria on Saturday after the violence spiraled out of control and SDF leaders who had relied on the United States sought help from the Syrian regime, which is backed by Russia and Iran.\n\nAD\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Sunday that Turkey had indicated it would launch its offensive \u201cregardless of what we did\u201d and that there was \u201cno way we could have stopped 15,000 Turks.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD\n\n\ufeffBut at least eight U.S. service members who served with Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq expressed disgust in interviews with The Washington Post about the rapid U.S. changes and the lack of a clear plan to prevent a crisis. Many of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, doubted that Turkish forces would have launched an assault into northern Syria if the White House had not said it would stand aside.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even look at the atrocities,\u201d an Army officer who served in Syria last year said of videos posted online of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish civilians. \u201cThe ISIS mission is going to stop, ISIS is going to have a resurgence, and we\u2019re going to have to go back in five years and do it all again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe added that while he was in the Middle East, military officials at the Pentagon sometimes discussed with officers in the field how they could craft a compelling case for Trump to stay longer while a thoughtful exit strategy could be designed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI remember hearing, \u2018How are we going to phrase terms to convince Trump not to go off a cliff?\u2019 \u201d the officer said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018How do you steer him to the right decision and not where he wants to go?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnother Army officer who deployed to Syria a few times and has knowledge of ongoing operations predicted in an interview Saturday that if the United States didn\u2019t change its policy within 48 hours, \u201ceverything over the last five years is done.\u201d Within hours, Trump had ordered a full U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria.\n\nThe officer said the United States aided the Turkish offensive by talking the SDF into taking down some of its defenses in the border region under the premise that the United States would stay involved and then allowing the Turkish operation to go forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFolks are heartbroken,\u201d the second officer said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than if we had said, \u2018We are getting out of Syria in six months.\u2019 Reasonable-man definition says that we facilitated that attack.\u201d\n\nThe abrupt change followed more than a year of Trump pressing to get U.S. troops out of Syria, with directives for the military to withdraw passed in April and December 2018. The latter one prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign, but in both cases, senior advisers talked Trump into slowing down.\n\nOne Special Forces soldier with several deployments to northern Syria said he blamed senior military leaders for not finding a way out of Syria faster given Trump\u2019s well-known desires.\n\nAD\n\nThe Kurdish forces fought hard, but the U.S. partnership with them was always going to be problematic, he said. The Kurdish fighters in Syria have links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, in Turkey, which both Ankara and Washington have labeled a terrorist organization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf someone had presented Trump with a six-month withdrawal plan and actually stuck to it, we wouldn\u2019t be having these conversations,\u201d the soldier said. \u201cYou can tell me horror stories and show me intel reports, and none of it would matter to me. I fully support withdrawing from Syria.\u201d\n\nEarly in Special Forces training, soldiers are taught not to \u201cfall in love with your partner force,\u201d he said. That means they learn to build up other groups like the SDF, but only in support of U.S. interests. He recalled seeing Kurds in Syria hoist a banner of Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK\u2019s jailed leader, after one operation and wearing PKK memorabilia on their uniforms.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur collective entity in Syria tried to explain to them: \u2018You can\u2019t do that. If you do that, it puts us in a very precarious position, and we are providing unparalleled and unequaled-in-history air support.\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey still did it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther soldiers said Turkey\u2019s anger about the United States teaming up with Kurdish forces had been managed for more than two years and could continue to be contained. With teams of U.S. service members right along the border in Syria, they said, it was unlikely that Turkey would want to get into a war with the United States after their decades-long alliance in NATO.\n\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthy, asked Monday about the service members\u2019 criticism on Syria, said he likes candor but that soldiers must not be disobedient.\n\n\u201cEverybody has an opinion in a war of ideas,\u201d he said, speaking at a conference of the Association of the U.S. Army. \u201cBut ultimately, when national policy decisions are made, we salute and move out.\u201d"}, {"DocID": 28, "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/attention-turns-to-bolton-after-former-aide-told-impeachment-probe-he-fought-giulianis-shadow-operation-in-ukraine/2019/10/15/0fde31a4-ef52-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html", "published": "2019-10-15T20:24:00", "title": "House Democrats focus on Mulvaney, Bolton after key witness testimony in impeachment inquiry", "text": "The actions of Mulvaney and Bolton attracted considerable attention after two witnesses testified that the acting White House chief of staff was involved in setting up a separate channel to handle diplomacy with Ukraine, which angered Bolton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite stonewalling by the White House, investigators secured hours of testimony Tuesday from George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine. Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is slated to testify behind closed doors Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have been bringing witnesses in at quite a furious pace,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told reporters.\n\nLast month, the White House released a rough transcript of a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a time when U.S. military aid was being withheld from the country. A whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the call sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nIn congressional testimony, witnesses have painted a picture of a White House bitterly divided not just over Ukraine, which has long been reliant on military aid and political support from the United States as it fights Russian-backed separatists, but also over which political appointees were calling the shots on foreign policy: the experienced national security staff, or a group of Trump loyalists and the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nIn testimony Tuesday, Kent said Mulvaney organized a meeting last spring where officials decided to take Ukraine policy out of the traditional channels, putting Energy Secretary Rick Perry, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and then-special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in charge instead.\n\nKent told House investigators that he was instructed to \u201clay low,\u201d focus on the five other countries in his portfolio, and defer to Volker, Sondland and Perry \u2014 who called themselves the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2014 on matters related to Ukraine, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nFiona Hill, the National Security Council\u2019s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, told investigators Monday that Bolton was infuriated by a shadow operation being conducted by Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the president\u2019s political rival.\n\nAD\n\nHill said Bolton, who instructed her to raise the matter with White House lawyers, even likened Giuliani to a \u201chand grenade,\u201d according to two people familiar with her testimony. Hill also testified that Bolton wanted to make clear that he was not involved and very opposed to what he called the \u201cdrug deal\u201d between Mulvaney and Sondland, the people said.\n\nSchiff, in consultation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), would decide on calling Mulvaney and Bolton to testify, but several Democrats said they wanted to interview the two.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMulvaney has the inside understanding of why the money was withheld on the security assistance,\u201d said Rep.

Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). \u201cI suspect we will [need to hear from them]; we need to get the facts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPelosi again Tuesday rejected calls by Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote on an impeachment inquiry, arguing that neither the Constitution nor House rules require it.\n\nThe decision to forgo a formal vote was prompted by a combination of concerns, according to multiple Democratic aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. A handful of vulnerable Democratic \u201cfrontliners\u201d seeking reelection in GOP-leaning districts see some political peril in taking a vote to authorize a formal probe, while a broader swath of the caucus simply balked at the notion of having Trump and his Republican allies dictate the terms of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 an argument that ultimately swayed Pelosi.\n\nAD\n\nInside a caucus meeting Tuesday night, Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), who represents a district Trump won by 15 points in 2016 and is one of only seven Democrats who have not endorsed the impeachment probe, argued to Pelosi and other leaders that the Constitution gives the House broad latitude in pursuing impeachment and that the chamber would be ill-served to \u201cplay into Republicans\u2019 hands\u201d and heed calls for a formal vote. \u201cYou said it perfectly,\u201d Pelosi replied, according to three people in the room, effectively shutting down further debate.\n\nAD\n\nIn a news conference after the meeting, Schiff defended the inquiry against GOP attacks targeting the secrecy of the closed-door interviews and asserting that the process has been unfair to Trump. Schiff compared the private nature of the probe to the secretive special-counsel investigations that preceded the articles of impeachment against Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Only after those probes were largely complete did the House vote to open formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nSchiff, moreover, argued that Republicans were simply seeking to distract from Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to discuss the president\u2019s conduct. They\u2019d rather talk process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPelosi left open the prospect of holding a vote later, and the Democratic aides said that moment could come if a judge ruled against the House in court, or after the three investigative committees wrap up their initial probe and prepare to hand a case to the House Judiciary Committee for the drafting of formal impeachment articles.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to find the truth. . . . This is deadly serious for us.\u201d\n\nDiscussions about next steps came as Vice President Pence, the Pentagon, the Office of Management and Budget, and Giuliani refused to cooperate with the investigation. Asked how the House planned to compel Trump allies to comply, Pelosi declined to answer.\n\nAD\n\nTrump ousted Bolton last month after a rocky relationship in which the two men clashed over policy on North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan, among other issues. The president even disparaged Bolton as he left, saying he had made \u201csome very big mistakes.\u201d\n\nBolton, who initially declined to comment, said in a text: \u201cI will have my say in due course.\u201d He is reportedly writing a book.\n\nMany of the revelations about Bolton\u2019s stance were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to one person familiar with Hill\u2019s testimony, Bolton was so alarmed by the efforts of Giuliani, Sondland and Mulvaney to circumvent the National Security Council and the diplomatic corps that he dispatched her to raise the concern with White House lawyers.\n\nAD\n\nThe order came after Volker, Bolton, Sondland, Hill and Perry met in early July. During the meeting, Sondland blurted out to the other officials that there were \u201cinvestigations that were dropped that need to be started up again\u201d in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, and Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who sat on its board.\n\nBolton went \u201cballistic\u201d after the meeting, the official said.\n\nHill herself got into a confrontation with Sondland over his involvement in Ukrainian affairs, according to one person familiar with her testimony, as Ukraine is not in the European Union and thus not part of his ambassadorial portfolio. Sondland said he had been put in charge by Trump, the person said \u2014 something Hill likened to the bravado of Alexander Haig, then secretary of state, who said he was in charge after a 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.\n\nAD\n\nSondland, who obeyed State Department orders not to show up for a planned deposition last week, is expected to testify in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry Thursday under subpoena. Text messages provided to the panel by Volker showed that it was Sondland who defended the president in early September, when other diplomats expressed concern that U.S. military assistance was being withheld from Ukraine to push its leaders to conduct a politically motivated investigation of Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board for five years; Joe Biden is currently making a White House bid.\n\nTrump told Mulvaney in mid-July to hold back almost $400 million in congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine. That order came the same week Hill resigned from the National Security Council; it also took place one week before Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone, when he appeared to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the White House will attempt to block parts of Sondland\u2019s testimony by asserting executive privilege over the president\u2019s interactions with the ambassador. But any claim of privilege could be distinctly weakened by the White House\u2019s decision to release a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe White House could have also missed an opportunity to claim privilege over Sondland\u2019s conversations by failing to assert privilege over Volker\u2019s testimony. If lawyers for Sondland \u2014 or eventually the courts \u2014 decide that means the president waived his right to claim privilege over the matters discussed in the texts Volker shared with the committees, Sondland would be able to speak freely.\n\nThe White House sent Hill letters before her deposition Monday warning her about respecting executive privilege, though it was never claimed officially to the committee. For those in government, testifying as the White House asserts privilege could come with professional consequences, but the White House has essentially no way to punish former officials \u2014 unless the information they share is classified, in which case disseminating it could be a crime."}, {"DocID": 29, "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/grief-accusations-surround-killing-of-kurdish-politician-in-northeastern-syria/2019/10/15/1c21437c-ef55-11e9-bb7e-d2026ee0c199_story.html", "published": "2019-10-15T18:18:12", "title": "Grief, accusations surround killing of Kurdish politician in northeastern Syria", "text": "Her death caused an outcry within Kurdish communities and leadership, which deemed it a war crime committed in the midst of a Turkish incursion into Syria\u2019s Kurdish-controlled northeast.\n\nAbout a week ago, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government launched a military operation that it said is aimed at clearing the Turkey-Syria border of Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom it accuses of links to Kurdish militants inside Turkey, and repatriating Syrian refugees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United States, which had partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against the Islamic State militant group in Syria, condemned the Turkish operation, as did other Western allies of Turkey, warning that it could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nKurdish leaders have accused an Islamist fighter of Khalaf\u2019s killing, identifying him as a member of the rebel group Ahrar al-Sharqiya.

If we find a terrorist or a spy, what do you expect us to do?\u201d the spokesman told The Post.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe day she was killed, she was on the 712 road,\u201d said Youssef Hammoud, a spokesman for the Syrian National Army. \u201cThat is tens of kilometers away from the M4\u201d \u2014 a highway that the National Army said it had reached during the fighting.\n\nAsser Khattab in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nAD"}, {"DocID": 30, "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-arabia-breaks-its-decades-long-boycott-to-play-soccer-in-the-west-bank/2019/10/14/9cd78ca0-eea2-11e9-bb7e-d2026ee0c199_story.html", "published": "2019-10-15T17:05:00", "title": "Some booed Saudi-Palestinian soccer match in West Bank even before it started", "text": "So when the Green Falcons ran out on the field as visitors at Faisal al-Husseini stadium, it ended Saudi Arabia\u2019s decades-long boycott of playing in the West Bank in protest of Israel\u2019s control over Palestinian borders. Some Palestinian activists condemned the Saudis\u2019 appearance for \u201cnormalizing\u201d the status quo as part of a subtle recent thawing of relations between the Arab power and Israel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the governing Palestinian Authority hailed the game as a boost for sovereignty over local turf, if only the turf of a soccer pitch.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the Saudi team here to play for the first time on our own soil,\u201d said Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after the players had stepped off their bus from the Jordanian border for a welcome that would include a state dinner and a visit to al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2015, during the last lead-up to\n\nthe World Cup, the United Arab Emirates became the first team willing to play in the modern, 12,500-seat stadium next to the concrete security wall dividing Israeli and Palestinian territory. But the Saudis, considered then as now the dominant soccer power in the region, refused an invitation to follow suit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is in a different league, just a massive brand in the Arab world,\u201d said Uri Levy, a Jerusalem-based soccer journalist who was the first to report on the Saudis\u2019 change of heart for this round. \u201cThis decision will have huge consequences.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInterest in the game was sky-high among West Bank fans. Thousands of free tickets were distributed in hours by the local phone company, Jawwal.\n\n\u201cPeople are thrilled the Saudis are here,\u201d said Hamad Tomaleh, who was wearing a Palestinian national jersey and handing out tickets in the Ramallah mall. Soccer \u201cis like religion here.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Palestinians, in front of a crowd that overflowed onto surrounding rooftops, would hold the Saudis to a 0-0 tie.\n\nAD\n\nBut it is the political gamesmanship that has generated controversy. The Israeli government hasn\u2019t commented on the Saudi-Palestinian match, but Israel has historically welcomed such ordinary interactions with its Arab neighbors.\n\nFurther, the country is widely seen as waging an unacknowledged effort to ease tensions with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, mostly over their shared concerns about Iran. The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment for this article.\n\nA number of Palestinian activists and militant groups denounced both the Palestinian Authority for inviting the Saudis and the Saudis for accepting. Some, pointing out that Israel won\u2019t even allow Palestinian teams from the Gaza Strip to travel to the West Bank stadium, launched an online campaign against the Saudi appearance under the banner: \u201cNormalization is treason.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKhalil Shaheen, a political analyst at the Palestinian Center for Policy Research and Strategic Studies-Masarat in Ramallah, said Abbas and the Palestinian leadership were too eager to host an important game.\n\n\u201cHe is achieving the Israeli goal without knowing it,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThis is what gives Israel an excuse to say things are normal here.\u201d\n\nSaudi and Palestinian officials rejected the criticism.\n\n\u201cJust by visiting the prisoners at the jail doesn\u2019t mean that you are supporting the jailers,\u201d Jibril Rajoub, the fiery head of the Palestinian Football Association, said in an interview after a dinner with the Saudi delegation in the West Bank town of Rawabi. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the Palestinian people, and it\u2019s good for the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Palestinians launched a major effort to lure the Saudi team. Rajoub, a high-ranking member of Abbas\u2019s Fatah party who refers to himself as \u201can ex-freedom fighter who spent 17 years in Israeli jails,\u201d said he was on the phone with an invitation to his counterpart in Riyadh as soon as the World Cup group draw was announced. Abbas followed up with a personal appeal, according to the Saudis.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president of the Palestinian government sent a letter to our king,\u201d said Yasser al-Mishal, president of the Saudi Football Federation, who was at the dinner with Rajoub.\n\nAfter multiple meetings with both Jordanian and Palestinian officials, the Saudis decided to reverse their long-standing position.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is a simple right for every national team in the world to host their own games in their own stadium,\u201d Mishal said. \u201cWe thought that coming would also give a message to everyone that Palestine has its own territory and its own rights, and we support that.\u201d\n\nHe declined to address the political element, other than to say he was unaware of any approval needed from higher-ups in Saudi government.\n\n\u201cFrom my end, it\u2019s a purely sports event,\u201d he said.\n\nAD"}]}}
