The goal of this project is to implement an information retrieval system using Python and NLTK.

To build this system, it is provided a plain text file that contains many documents related to music lyrics.
Each document contains a Document ID which is used to make the posting list in the inverted index and the different terms in the documents are stemmed using porters2 algorithm.

Methods used to build the vectors:

(0) Standard Boolean Boolean

(1) TF weights

(2) TF-IDF weights

Instead of calculating the cosine angle between the querry and the vectors we have used the method of KL Divergence.
